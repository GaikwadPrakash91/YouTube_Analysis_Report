# YouTube Analysis Power BI Report

This repository contains a Power BI report analyzing YouTube statistics, created as part of a Capstone Project. The report includes visualizations such as:
- Key metrics (Max Uploads, Min View Rank, Avg Views Last 30 Days, Total Uploads)
- Subscribers by Category (Packed Bubble Chart)
- Navigation between Main Dashboard and Detailed Analysis pages

## Files
- `YouTube_Analysis.pbix`: The Power BI project file. Open in Power BI Desktop to interact with the report.
- `YouTube_Analysis.pdf`: A static PDF export of the report for quick viewing.

## How to Use
1. Download the `.pbix` file.
2. Open it in Power BI Desktop to explore the interactive report.
3. Use the "Go to Details" button to navigate to the Detailed Analysis page (note: navigation is not available in the PDF).

## Notes
- The report is missing a heading and logo (to be added as per Task 12).
- The AvgViewsLast30Days value (176M) may need verification due to a potential data anomaly.
